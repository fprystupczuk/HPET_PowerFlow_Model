The feeders presented here are obtained from [1]. Nonetheless, they have been modified by V. Rigoni to reduce the number of nodes by:

1) Eliminating branches not supplying power to any customer
2) Merging consecutive branches with equal cable data (no customers connected to nodes in between)

Data for PV profiles comes also from [1]
